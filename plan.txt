Plan for chat application:

Features that are necessary:
	- Chat if you're logged in
	- Host and Raid notifications
	- Sub, resub, and sub gift notification

How to make these, it should be simple.

Host and Raid notifications is just parsing things, and then I can make a custom messagecontrol with a different font or animation or something that just makes it cool.

Sub, Resub, And sub gift, I'm thinking of nudging the chat over, and displaying a huge panel with the name of the sub, and a celebration. This should have to be toggleable for obvious reasons.
