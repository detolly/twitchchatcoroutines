# Twitch Chat Coroutines

I don't know what I'm doing. 

## Description
A desktop c# twitch chat application, made with Unity Syntax Coroutines, hence the name. Supports BTTV, FrankerFaceZ or whatever it's called, and emote caching/storing. 

## Contributions
As long as it's a good and valid contribution I will accept it. (Assuming it actually is relevant to the project, which is making a desktop twitch chat)
