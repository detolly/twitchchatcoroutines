# Twitch Chat Coroutines

I don't know what I'm doing. 

## Description
A desktop c# twitch chat application, made with Unity Syntax Coroutines for animations, hence the name. Supports BTTV, FrankerFaceZ or whatever it's called, and emote caching/storing. 

## Cool uses for this application
- It has animations, if you're into that.
- Can be used as a OBS chat, so you can Color key the background color (which you choose yourself), and have the chat on the screen.
- It can be used as a normal chat, but better performance in case you don't want to be on the website itself. (Chrome eats memory and CPU, I know)
- You can download the code and learn how it works. But beware, it's horrible code, and you will have nightmares after seeing it.

## Installation
1. Go to the downloads section.
2. Download the Zip file.
3. Extract contents to a folder.
4. Open TwitchChatCoroutines.exe
5. Update to the newest version, if you want.
6. Enjoy your shiny new virus. Kappa.

## Credit
+ Newtonsoft.JSON for the fantastic JSON parse read whatever. It's great. We need people like him to make great things, because some of us don't make great things. And we need that. Great things.
+ To you for using the program, although you probably used it once and forgot about it.

## Contributions
As long as it's a good and valid contribution I will accept it. (Assuming it actually is relevant to the project, which is making a desktop twitch chat)
